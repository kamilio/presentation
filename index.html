# The Visual Component Library “VCL“
## Modular, extensible CSS

Thomas Hoppe in 2015

---

# What is it?

> **Modular** and **extensible** CSS library for Web development today and tomorrow –
> the era of component-based Web application development.

- It's 100% JS free
- It can be combined with EmberJS, Angular, React etc.
- You must not use any styles, you can also just use the infrastructure

---

# Terminology

__Component__: A style definition for a UI element

__Module__: An NPM module containing 1 - n components

__Theme__: A component which only defines variables for other components

__Theme terms__: High level theme defining colors, shades and fonts

---

# Technically

- Preprocessor based on 
[rework](https://github.com/reworkcss)

- Package management based on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
as task runner

---

# Why is it _modular_?

Because you can use whatever modules you want
for your styling needs. 

Modules can be from the official VCL repos
from third parties or your own ones.

We use **soft dependencies** specified 
as `devDependencies` in `package.json` files ‒
e. g.:

    "devDependencies": {
      "gulp": "^3.8.10",
      "gulp-vcl-preprocessor": "git://github.com/vcl/gulp-vcl-preprocessor",
      "normalize.css": "^3.0.2",
      "pre-commit": "^1.0.6",
      "vcl-build-demo": "git://github.com/vcl/build-demo",
      "vcl-default-theme": "git://github.com/vcl/default-theme",
      "vcl-default-theme-terms": "git://github.com/vcl/default-theme-terms",
      "vcl-font-awesome": "git://github.com/vcl/font-awesome",
      "vcl-form": "git://github.com/vcl/form",
      "vcl-form-control-label": "git://github.com/vcl/form-control-label",
      "vcl-icon": "git://github.com/vcl/icon",
      "vcl-preprocessor": "git://github.com/vcl/preprocessor"
    }

---

# Why is it _extensible_?

It is in many ways:

- You can add your own components components
- You can extend existing components by adding CSS rules
- You can adapt existing components by overriding styles and/ or variables

Everything through modules.

Extensions do not distrupt the build process.

---

# How do Imports work?

The normal CSS `@import` statement is used in two flavors:

Import a module via `@import "<module name>"`

Import a local file via `@import "<file name>.styl|css"`

---

# Components by Example

See what makes up a component by the _button_: 

[https://github.com/vcl/button](https://github.com/vcl/button)

---

# Putting it together

Best explained by an include hierarchy of a typical project:

    @import "vcl-default-theme-terms"   ← Use the terms of the default theme 
    @import "vcl-default-theme"         ← Use the default theme
    @import "./vcl-var-override.styl"   ← Override some vars
    @import "vcl-core-modules"          ← Use the collection of core modules
    @import "vcl-font-awesome"          ← Use font awesome
    @import "./own-modules.css"         ← Add some own stuff

---

# What exists currently?

There is a collection of **~70 __core modules__**
with components ranging from typographical styles for text,
links, lists etc. to complex widgets like a date picker.
They roughly make up for what you can find in Bootstrap plus some 
extensions.

---

# Browser Compatibility

Is mainly a build time decision, 
how you parameterize
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

As a result, even IE8 is possible for 
many components.

On the other hand some components
use _flexbox_, _transitions_,
_media queries_ etc. which are not
available in older browsers.

---

# WARNING, It is opinionated

- Source is written in
[white space significant syntax](https://www.npmjs.org/package/css-whitespace), `.styl` suffix
- Uses relative units like `em`, `rem` everywhere (except for some borders)
- CamelCased class names like `vclFlipSwitch`

---

# How to “run“ a Component

````bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vcl/date-picker.git

$ cd date-picker

$ npm install

$ npm start
````

This will:
1. install the `gulp-vcl-preprocessor` 
2. install all dependent VCL modules 
3. Build the styles and copy stuff to the `build` folder
4. Start a web server, serving the `build` folder
5. Open your browser to show all demos from the `demo` folder

---

# How to build a Distribution?

[See the tutorial](https://github.com/vcl/doc/tree/master/tutorial).

# Status

The VCL has gone a very long way, it has ben initiated years ago.
It's battle proven in:

- Static web sites
- Single page app based web sites
- Mobile apps
- Enterprise apps

But we are on a conservative **0.1.0 version level** that we 
froze in summer 2015.

Of course we adhere to
[semver](http://semver.org/).

We did not publish to NPM yet
but consider this in the future.

---

# Open Issues / Roadmap

- Document classes and modifiers better

- More components

- Conditional builds

---

# Who's behind it?

- Mainly created and maintained by [n-fuse](http://www.n-fuse.de) employees

- 6 comitters currently

- Open for your contributions!
