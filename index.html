# The Visual Component Library “VCL“
## Modular, extensible CSS

Thomas Hoppe in 2016

---

# What is it?

<span class="big">
A **Modular** and **extensible** approach to CSS for the era of component-based
Web application development.
</span>

<br>

- Moular, not a framework, 100% JS-free at runtime

- For static sites and MV* framework driven SPAs (EmberJS, Angular, React...)

- Does not break your build process, it's part of it

- Existing library of 85 ready-to-use modules

---

# Terminology

__Component__: A self-contained UI element like a button

__Module__: An NPM module containing 1 - n components

__Theme__: A module which only defines variables for other components

__Theme terms__: High level theme defining colors, shades and fonts

---

# Technical Basis

- [Preprocessor](https://github.com/vcl/preprocessor) based on
[rework css](https://github.com/reworkcss)
  - [Gulp Task](https://github.com/vcl/gulp-vcl-preprocessor) available

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) as
package management vehicle and module registry

---

# Why is it _modular_?

Because components are packaged as NPM modules which can be:

- from the VCL org's repositories
- third parties
- your own ones

This allows you to use exactly the modules you need
to cover the styling needs of a project.

---

# How is it _extensible_?

It is in several ways:

- You can create your own components

- You can extend existing components by adding CSS rules

- You can adapt existing components by overriding styles and/ or variables

Everything through modules

Extensions can thus seamlessly be integrated a build process

---

# Installing Modules

```shell
$ npm install vcl-button
```

---

# “Running“ the Demos of a Module

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/vcl/date-picker.git

$ cd date-picker

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

This will:

1. install the `gulp-vcl-preprocessor`
2. install all dependent VCL modules
3. Build the styles and copy stuff to the `build` folder
4. Start a web server, serving the `build` folder
5. Open your browser to show all demos from the `demo` folder

---

# Using Modules

The CSS `@import`-statement is used to import modules and files:

Import a module via

```CSS
@import "<module name>"
```

Import a local file via

```CSS
@import "<file name>.styl|css"
```

---

# Anatomy of a Module

See what makes up a module using the example of the _button_:

[https://github.com/vcl/button](https://github.com/vcl/button)

This definition in `package.json` specifies the index style file:

`"style": "index.styl"`

It functions in the same way as the `main` property for JS-modules.

---

# Soft Dependencies

Soft dependencies via `devDependencies` are used to specify the
dependencies of modules to run the demos. An example `package.json`:

```JavaScript
"devDependencies": {
  "gulp": "^3.9.0",
  "gulp-vcl-preprocessor": "^0.1.0",
  "normalize.css": "^3.0.2",
  "pre-commit": "^1.0.6",
  "vcl-build-demo": "^0.1.0",
  "vcl-default-theme": "^0.1.0",
  "vcl-default-theme-terms": "^0.1.0",
  "vcl-font-awesome": "^0.1.0",
  "vcl-icon": "^0.1.0",
  "vcl-preprocessor": "^0.1.0"
}
```

---

# Real World Example

Best explained by a typical `index.styl` of a web app:

```
@import "vcl-default-theme-terms"   ← Use the terms of the default theme
@import "vcl-default-theme"         ← Use the default theme
@import "./vcl-var-override.styl"   ← Override some vars
@import "vcl-core-modules"          ← Use the collection of core modules
@import "vcl-font-awesome"          ← Use font awesome
@import "./own-modules.css"         ← Add some own stuff
```

---

# Current Module Stock

- There is a collection of **~70 __core modules__**
  * with components ranging from typographical styles for text,
links, lists etc. to complex widgets like a date picker.
  - They provide roughly wahat you can find in Twitter Bootstrap

- ~85 Modules from the VCL org's repos

<br>
Check the
**[Generated Docs of all Core Modules](https://vcl.github.io/)**.

---

# WARNING, It is opinionated

- CSS code is written using the
[white space significant syntax](https://www.npmjs.org/package/css-whitespace),
`.styl` suffix
  - You can also use plain CSS for your components

- Uses relative units like `em`, `rem` everywhere (except for some borders)

- camelCased class naming, like `vclFlipSwitch`

- Embraces flexbox

- More about this in the [guidelines](https://github.com/vcl/doc/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)

---

# Browser Compatibility

Is mainly a build time decision,
how you parameterize
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

As a result, even IE8 is possible for
many components.

On the other hand some components
use _flexbox_, _transitions_,
_media queries_ etc. which are not
available in older browsers.

---

# Hover Media Queries Support

[Media Queries Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#hover)
allow to check if a device truly supports hovering or just emulates it.
Emulated hovering has some ugly quirks, like staying in the _:hover_ state even
after the user stops interacting with it, so you might want to disable hovering
for devices which emulate hovering.

It's a pretty new WD, but support already
[exists in some browser engines](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media-interaction).

A complementary browser shim like
[mq4-hover-shim](https://github.com/twbs/mq4-hover-shim#mq4-hover-shim)
is required to enable/ disable hover support through a prefix-class put on
a top-level element.

To enable it, the preprocessor needs to be parameterized like this:

```json
{ hoverSelectorPrefix: 'some-prefix' };
```

# Creating Builds

1.) Via CLI

```shell
$ npm install -g vcl-preprocessor

$ vcl-preprocessor index.styl dist/compiled.css
```

2.) `package.json` script

```JavaScript
"scripts": {
  "build-css": "vcl-preprocessor index.styl vcl.css"
}
```

3.) [Gulp task](https://github.com/vcl/gulp-vcl-preprocessor)

---

# The Doc Generator

The [doc-gen](https://github.com/vcl/doc-gen)
allows to generate a browsable catalog of all VCL modules used
in a project.

- The documentation and the demos can be browsed conveniently

- Includes all VCL modules in the dependency tree (“recursive“)

- Completely introspection based; no registry or manual enumeration required

---

# Doc related Module Meta Data in `package.json`

The doc-generator is fed by the `categories` part of the meta data.

- A module can have multiple categories
- The priorities affect the sort order in the menu of the generated
  documentation

```JavaScript
"vcl": {
  "categories": [
    {
      "title": "Buttons",
      "itemPriority": 10,     ← Order of the category
      "priority": 80          ← Order of the module within the category
    }
  ]
}
```

There is a
[list of categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcl/doc/master/component_categories.yml)
but it's not mandatory to use them.

---

# Creating Docs

1.) Via CLI

```shell
$ npm install -g vcl-doc-gen

$ vcl-doc-gen --entry ./package.json --output doc.html
```

2.) Via `package.json` script

```JavaScript
"scripts": {
  "doc-gen": "vcl-doc-gen && opn ./vcl-documentation.html",
}
```

Check the **[VCL tutorial](https://github.com/vcl/doc/tree/master/tutorial)**
project to see everything put together.

---

# Status

The VCL has come quite a long way, initiated as a monolith years ago.
It's battle proven in:

- Static web sites
- Single page app based web sites
- Mobile apps
- Enterprise apps

We are on a conservative **0.1.0 version level** that we
released in summer 2015.

Of course we adhere to
[semver](http://semver.org/).

The 0.1.x series of modules is published on npm.

---

# Open Issues / Roadmap

- Enhance documentation of modules

- RTL support

- Even more components

- Support for [@apply](http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule/#at-ruledef-apply) based extends for easy theme extension

- Support themes better in doc-gen

- Ability to scope modules to a web component via [ICSS](https://github.com/css-modules/icss)

---

# Who's behind it?

- Mainly created and maintained by [n-fuse](http://www.n-fuse.de) employees

- 6 comitters currently

**We are open for your contributions!**
